# MyDFS
A simple distribuited file system made for my exam of System Progamming.

Made in C, ported from Linux to Windows.

Sadly all the documentation and the project details are in Italian. Sorry!

You can find the project details [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/FedericoPonzi/MyDFS/blob/master/Traccia.md), and my writeup is [here](https://raw.github.com/FedericoPonzi/MyDFS/blob/master/Relazioneprogrammazionedisistema.pdf).
